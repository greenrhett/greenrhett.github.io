								<p>For this project I created a real world demo that demonstrated my knowledge of embedded systems and the role they play in cybersecurity. I implemented an attack on my computer, a 2017 MacBook Pro that would grant me remote access to the computers file system and more. Initially, I attempted to gain access through open ports via IP address retrieval and port scanning but the nature of MacOS operating system made this unlikely. Had it been a Windows based operating system, this approach could have been more viable since Mac's operating system is more secure. I needed a different entry approach so I created a RAT or remote access trojan and installed it on my system by disguising it as a basic file that when clicked creates a backdoor opening a meterpreter session between the victims system and my host system from which I can access their files and even plant new ones for further attacks. Meterpreter is a metasploit attack payload that when injected resides completely in memory and writes nothing to the disk making it hard for antivirus software to detect because most AV systems work by detecting and monitoring new files on the disk. The meterpreter payload creates a reverse_tcp shell by installing the payload on the victims computer through a link and setting up a listener on the attackers device on a desired port of your choosing. As soon as the link is clicked on the victims device, it connects to the listener providing an interactive shell from which the attacker can explore the target machine and execute code. This attack is flexible and can be tailored for multiple types of operating systems and hardware. Due to legal concerns I used a virtual machine to run Kali Linux to test the attack results in a closed environment. Below is my demonstration of the attack:
