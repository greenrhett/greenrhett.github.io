							<p>To create my first person shooter game, I used the Unreal Engine 4 which is the same platform the popular game Fortnite runs on. Unreal engine is C++ based development, but they offer a helpful GUI that allows you to build the game through blueprinting. Blueprinting is a complete gameplay scripting system based on the concept of using a node-based interface to create gameplay elements to define object-oriented classes or objects in the engine. At first it was a bit overwhelming but it's structure was very similar to the object oriented programming I've done in the past. Upon opening the engine I was prompted with an interface asking what game I was developing. I choose FPS and I was given the starting template as shown below:
								<div class="image main">
										<img src="images/templateMore1.png" width = "900" height = "400" controls></img>
									</div>
							</p>

								<p> Now that I had a good starting point for the game I began working on my map that the users would interact with. I did this using white-boxing which is the process of placing primitives to represent the final shape and volume of the level. After I had created my level I began work on the physics. For example if a primitive had the wrong physics it would not interact with the character as it should. After all the walls and floors had the right physics settings, I added textures to complete the look of the level as shown below:
									<div class="image main">
									<img src="images/Screen Shot 2021-07-03 at 2.19.09 PM.png" width="900" height="400" controls></img>
								</div>
								</p>

							<p> Next, I began work on the bodies of the characters because I needed an object for the users to hit and kill. Once the bodies were added, I created a socket which is a node point for the computer to hold objects or in this case the gun. Next, I gave the charcacters health that could be depleted till death. This was done by creating a widget which is a class used to handle the display of UI elements in the game. A health bar was added that held a float value of 1.0 and attatched to the character blueprint (class designed to handle everything to do with the characters). I then created a character User Interface to handle the updating of the health bar when the player was hit. It was controlled by a branch that acted like an if statement, if the player was hit I subtracted the health value by 0.1 and if the value was < or = to 0, I played a death montage that cut the physics from the character and ragdolled the body.

									<figcaption>The branch becomes true when the player no longer has any health left, calling the "OnDeath" event. This event releases the character and prompts a "You Died" widget alerting the player of their demise all while removing the character from the parent class</figcaption>

							</p>

							<p> Next, I developed server and lobby control to make the game multiplayer. The host users internet acts as a server for the game session. When the user clicks "host" a server is created at their local IP address and the other player or client inputs the IP address into the text box and presses "connect", automatically loading them into the host's lobby. I created another widget to overlay on the screen with the host and connect buttons along with a text entry box for the IP address.
								<div class="image main">
									<figcaption>Blueprint for the host and connect button that during event "on clicked" open the level according to the IP address</figcaption>
									<img src="images/button actions.png" width="900" height="350" controls></img>
								</div>
								</p>
							
								<p>After opening the game and attempting to play, I realized I couldn't free my mouse to enter the IP address for multiplayer play. Therefore I created a simple key bind to free my cursor</p>
								<div class="image main">

								<p> Due to file limits of free web hosting, I cannot attach the game to the website or github. If you wish to play the game contact me via email: rhett.green9@gmail.com</p>
